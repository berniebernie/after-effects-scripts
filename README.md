# after-effects-scripts

Some scripts I wrote and/or modifided to improve my After Effects workflow. A lot of smaller, useful snippets can be found over on [my wiki](http://berniebernie.fr/wiki/Afx_Javascript)

* [simpleLocalProxy.jsx](https://github.com/berniebernie/after-effects-scripts/blob/master/simpleLocalProxy.jsx): simple tool to transfer network (slow) files to a local temporary folder (fast) and use that as a proxy
